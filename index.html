        <h1>Merry Christmas!</h1><br>
        <p>Christmas is a Christian festival that celebrates the birth of Jesus Christ, who Christians believe was the
            son of God. For most people, it takes place every year on 25 December – the day that the Roman Catholic
            Church chose to mark Jesus’ birthday. But, in fact, no one actually knows the exact date Jesus was born!</p>
        <br>
        <p>The name ‘Christmas’ comes from the old English phrase Cristes maesse, which means ‘Christ’s mass’. But what
            about ‘Xmas’? Lots of people think this is just a modern-day abbreviation – but it actually dates back to
            the 16th century! The ‘X’ is said to represent the Greek letter ‘Chi’– the first letter in the Greek word
            for Christ, Χριστός (pronounced ‘Christos’). </p>

        <h2>"Wishing you and your loved ones a blessed Christmas."</h2><br>

        <p style="color: rgb(156, 60, 60);">The Christmas story is a story of a family that connects heaven and earth. Each member of Jesus's earthly family—Mary, Joseph, and Jesus—stands as supernal examples of God's Christmas gift to all mankind. The Christmas story should spiritually motivate us to emulate the attributes of this holy family.</p><br>
        <p style="color: rgb(156, 60, 60);">“Christmas is like candy; it slowly melts in your mouth sweetening every
            taste bud, making you wish it could last forever.” <br> ― Richelle E. Goodrich
